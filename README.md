# CMP--Data-analysis
## Problem

Semiconductor production is characterized by complex, multi-stage processes in which even the smallest deviations can lead to waste (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018, p. 5). Despite automation, production often remains inefficient and requires manual interventions that affect productivity. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for process standardization and error reduction, but encounters challenges in integration into existing production processes due to data requirements and implementation complexity (Brynjolfsson, Rock & Syverson, 2017, p. 18).

In semiconductor manufacturing, specific recipes are used for the production of wafers, which contain detailed parameters and instructions for various process steps, such as etching, dosing or chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). These recipes are divided into basic recipes, which serve as general standards for specific materials and process steps, and into plant recipes, which are adapted to the specific requirements of individual plants. In the field of<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> CMP (chemical-mechanical polishing)</mark> there are different materials, such as t<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ungsten oxide and copper</mark>, which, depending on the type of material, require specific systems or adapted recipe variants. Since some systems are optimized for a single material and others can process several materials, the total of eleven systems available create numerous sub-recipes. This complex recipe structure leads to a high administrative burden and makes standardization and efficiency in the production process more difficult. A simplification or Standardization of this process or the recipes themselves, optimizes this process holistically.
