# Semiconductor Manufacturing Process Optimization with UMAP and GMM 🛠️

## 📈 Overview

Semiconductor manufacturing involves complex, multi-stage processes where even minor deviations can result in significant waste. Although automation is used, inefficiencies remain, often requiring manual interventions. This project utilizes **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** for dimensionality reduction and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for clustering to improve process standardization and error reduction in semiconductor production. 🤖

## 🧐 Problem

In semiconductor production, **recipes** define the steps for wafer manufacturing, such as etching, dosing, and chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). These recipes are categorized as:

- **Basic Recipes:** General standards for specific materials and processes. 📜
- **Plant Recipes:** Custom recipes tailored to plant-specific requirements. 🏭

The CMP process involves materials like tungsten oxide and copper, each requiring different systems and recipe variants. With **11 systems** in use, many optimized for specific materials, this leads to a large number of sub-recipes, increasing administrative overhead. This complexity hinders standardization and reduces production efficiency. ⚙️

## 🚀 Approach

This project uses **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction and **GMM** for clustering to:

- Simplify the recipe structure by identifying clusters of similar recipes using GMM. 🔍
- Visualize high-dimensional process data with UMAP to uncover patterns and key features. 📊
- Optimize process steps and reduce the number of sub-recipes, improving efficiency. 🏆

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Collect process data from various recipes, systems, and materials. 
   - Normalize and preprocess the data for analysis. 🧑‍💻

2. **Dimensionality Reduction with UMAP:** 
   - Apply UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the data, enabling easier analysis and visualization of high-dimensional features. 🔽

3. **Clustering with GMM:** 
   - Use GMM to identify clusters of similar recipes, making it easier to standardize processes and streamline production. 🧩

4. **Optimization:** 
   - Analyze the clusters to identify inefficiencies, redundancies, or deviations in the process. 
   - Propose a simplified and standardized recipe structure for improved production. ⚡

## 🏅 Key Benefits

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** UMAP makes high-dimensional data more manageable, helping identify trends and patterns. 📉
- **Cluster Identification:** GMM groups similar recipes, reducing the number of unique sub-recipes and optimizing workflow. 📦
- **Process Optimization:** Identifying inefficiencies and deviations helps streamline production and improve overall efficiency. 🔄
